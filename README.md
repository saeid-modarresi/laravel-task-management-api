# Senior PHP Backend Developer ‚Äì Coding Assessment

Thank you for taking the time to complete this assessment.  
The goal is to demonstrate how you approach architecture, testing, and backend engineering best practices.

## üìñ Project: Collaborative Task Management API

### Objective
Build a REST API for managing projects, tasks, comments, and notifications.  
We value **clean architecture, thoughtful design, and code quality** over speed or feature quantity.

---

## ‚úÖ Requirements

### Core Features
- **Authentication**: User registration & login (JWT or Laravel Sanctum).
- **Projects**: CRUD operations. Each project belongs to a user.
- **Tasks**:
  - CRUD operations.
  - Fields: `title, description, status (todo/in-progress/done), due_date`.
  - Filtering: by status, due date, full-text search.
  - Pagination for listing.
- **Comments**: CRUD operations. Each comment belongs to a task.
- **Notifications**:
  - Triggered when a task is assigned or updated.
  - Delivered asynchronously (e.g., queue).
  - Endpoint for fetching unseen notifications.

### Non-Functional
- Use a layered architecture (controllers, services, repositories, domain models).
- Apply at least two meaningful design patterns (e.g., Repository, Strategy, Observer).
- Database migrations must be included.
- Cache task listings (e.g., Redis).
- Add rate limiting for sensitive endpoints.
- Standardized error handling and responses.

### Testing
- Unit tests for core services and repositories.
- Integration tests for API endpoints.
- Minimum **70% test coverage**.

### DevOps
- `Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml` for local setup.
- CI pipeline runs automatically (tests, static analysis, linting, security).
- Compatible with **PHP 8.2+**.

### Documentation
- Update this `README.md` to include:
  - Setup instructions.
  - Example API requests (curl/Postman).
  - Explanation of your architectural decisions and trade-offs.
  - Which design patterns you applied, and why.

## üéØ Acceptance Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated on:

- **Architecture & Patterns**: Separation of concerns, justified design patterns.
- **Code Quality & Standards**: PSR-12 compliance, maintainability.
- **Feature Completeness**: Requirements implemented.
- **Testing**: Coverage, meaningful cases, edge-case handling.
- **Documentation**: Clear and professional.
- **DevOps**: CI/CD awareness, Docker setup.

## üìù Commit Guidelines

We value not only the final code but also how you structure your work.  
Please use **meaningful, structured commit messages** throughout your development.  

- Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) style when possible:  
  - `feat:` ‚Äì for new features  
  - `fix:` ‚Äì for bug fixes  
  - `chore:` ‚Äì for setup, configuration, or maintenance  
  - `test:` ‚Äì for adding or improving tests  
  - `docs:` ‚Äì for documentation changes  

- Examples:  
  - `chore: initial commit (Laravel project setup)`  
  - `feat: add task CRUD endpoints`  
  - `fix: correct due date validation logic`  

Your commit history will be reviewed as part of the assessment to understand how you approach iteration, problem-solving, and communication through code.


## üì¶ Submission Instructions
1. Implement your solution inside this repo.
2. Push to a private GitHub repository.
3. Invite the following reviewers with **Read**  role: `gh-ewmateam`.
4. Please complete within 7 days of receiving the assignment.
5. If you need more time, let us know.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Notes
1. The project is designed to take 3‚Äì5 hours. We do not expect a production-ready system.
2. Quality matters more than quantity ‚Äî partial solutions are acceptable if well-documented.
3. Document anything you would do differently with more time.

Good luck, and thank you again for your effort!
